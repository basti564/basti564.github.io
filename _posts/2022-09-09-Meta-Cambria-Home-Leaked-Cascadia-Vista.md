If you're a fan of the Oculus Quest 2 and have been keeping an eye on the latest news and leaks, you might have heard about the highly anticipated Seacliff headset. One of the most exciting features of the Seacliff is the exclusive home environment called Cascadia.

Recently, Cascadia was leaked and I made a patched version available for download [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/867876408482988052/1017556822648950804/cascadia_unlock.apk). This patch was created to allow the environment to run on the Quest 2. If you'd prefer to see a video of the environment, you can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pomxLO4qzCo).

It's clear that Cascadia is an absolutely stunning environment. It features beautiful interior design, and stunning waterfalls and cascades. The environment also has a cozy fire pit, plenty of seating options, and a place to rest and relax.

One of the standout features of Cascadia is its sharp, detailed models and graphics. The carpet and leaves on the ground are particularly impressive, and the overall design is a testament to the talent of the Meta environment designers.

Overall, Cascadia looks like it will be an amazing addition to the Seacliff headset and a must-see for any VR enthusiast. Thanks to the patch created by the VR community, anyone with a Quest 2 (and possibly Quest 1) can now experience this beautiful environment. We can't wait to see more of what the Seacliff has in store!
