## Video Tutorial
If you prefer a video tutorial you can watch [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArXk_hob4RE) I made back in april, but please read the pinned comment as it's a little outdated.

## What is Telemetry?
Telemetry refers to FaceBook gathering data on the performance of your Quest and on how you use it. With that come serious privacy concerns as FaceBook isnâ€™t exactly known to respect the privacy of their users. Also while probably not noticable, telemetry can and will impact your battery usage and performance to some degree.

##### Side effects
Disabeling Telemetry has little sideeffect, the only ones known so far are
- Fitness tracking not working
- You won't be able to remove Oculess from your device (without a factory reset)

### Sideloading the APK
If you already know how to sideload an APK to the Quest, just download the APK from step 1.
1. Download the Oculess.apk from [here](https://github.com/basti564/Oculess/releases)
2. Follow this [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/RoIXxIfRNTw?t=125) by "Virtual Reality Oasis"
3. Click this icon in SideQuest

### Temporarily remove accounts

### Make Oculess Device Owner
1. Again open up SideQuest
